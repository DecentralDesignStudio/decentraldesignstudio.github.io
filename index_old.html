    <div class="text firstdiv"> <p>Decentral Design Studio develops concepts where product, new techniques, the society and economy of tomorrow meet.

 
      We design, research and develop open technical solutions, user experiences, and sustainable economic trading systems in food, finance, health and other sectors for a society with better distribution of possibilities, knowledge en health.</p>
    </div>
<div class="text seconddiv"> <p> 
  To achieve the above goals we mainly use these strategies: <br> 
  <ol>
  <li>We create a deeper understanding, engage and inspire by translating new ideas and techniques into communication and visuals that anyone can understand.</li>
  ‍<br>
  <li>We translate new ideas and techniques into powerful concepts and products so they get practical use and society and economy can benefit.</li>
  ‍ ‍<br>
  <li>We connect and bring together energy, ideas and people that move it towards realization.</li>
  ‍</ol>
  Oh, and we don't just wait for someone to come ask us to develop wonderful ideas. We also take action on our own initiative to get things moving :)
